A Discord Bot Token is a short phrase (represented as a jumble of letters and numbers)
that acts as a "key" to controlling a Discord Bot.
Tokens are used inside bot code to send commands back and forth to the API,
which in turn controls bot actions. Never share your Discord Bot Token with anyone.
